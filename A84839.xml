         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ABout the middle of the eleventh month</hi> 1655. George Fox <hi>being on his Journey with</hi> Edward Pyot <hi>of</hi> Briſtoll, <hi>nnd</hi> William Salt <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>from the farthermoſt parts of</hi> Cornwall <hi>towards</hi> Briſtoll, <hi>was moved of the Lord in bowels of compaſſion to the Ignorant in thoſe dark corners of the Nation, to give forth a paper for the directing their minds to the way of ſalvation, and the ſtirring of them up to prize their time, and the day of their viſitation, a true Copy whereof is as followeth.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe migthy day of the Lord is come, and coming. that all hearts ſhalbe made manifeſt, the ſecrets of every ones heart ſhalbe revealed with the light of Jeſus; which comes from Jeſus Chriſt who lighteth every man that cometh into the world, Who ſaith learn of me; <hi>This is my welbeloved Son,</hi> hear you him ſaith God, that lighteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that cometh into the world, that all men through him might believe, the world through him might have life: And Chriſt is come to teach himſelf the ſecond Prieſthood; and every one that will not hear this Prophet, which God hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114738:3"/> raiſed up, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of and ſaid, Like unto me will God raiſe you up a Prophet, him ſhall you hear: every one that doth not hear this Prophet is to be cut off; They that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law died under the hands of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but how much greater puniſhment ſhall come upon them, that ſhall neglect this great ſalvation Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaith, <hi>Learn of me, I am the way, the truth, and the life, who light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> which light lets him ſee his evill wayes, his evill deeds that he hath done, but if he hate that light, and goes on in the evill, this will be the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the light ſaith Chriſt; Therefore now you have time, prize it, this is the day of your viſitation, and ſalvation proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you, every one of you having a light which lets you ſee you ſhould not lye, nor do wrong, nor take Gods name in vain, nor ſteale, this is the light that ſhews you theſe evill deeds, which if you love it, it will lead you to Chriſt, who is the way to the Father, from whence it comes, where no unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enters, nor unholineſs; but if you do this light hate, this wilbe your condemnation, the light ſaith Chriſt, If you doe it love, and to it come, you will come to Chriſt, which will bring you off all the worlds teachers, and wayes, and Doctrines, to Chriſt who is the way to the Father, from the world and all the deceivers in it.</p>
            <p>Which paper as they journyed through the Pariſh of <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne</hi> near St <hi>Ives?</hi> was delivered to a man whom they met (altogether, then, unknown to them, but ſince underſtood to be by name <hi>John Keate</hi>) to be communicated to the people, but he inſtead thereof haſtned and carried it to <hi>Peter Ceely</hi> Juſtice of the Peace, ſo called at St. <hi>Ives,</hi> who gave him order to get together a party of new raiſed Horſe, of which the ſaid <hi>Peter Ceely</hi> was Captain, and to follow after, and apprehend them.</p>
            <p>But they being come into the town of Saint <hi>Jves,</hi> before thoſe Horſe were gotten ready, as they were riding thorough it, the ſaid <hi>Keate</hi> being there, ſtopt them in their way, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them, and ſeized on their Horſes, and Portmantue, which he violently took away, and brought them to the ſaid

Now our Books are our Goods, and our Goods are our Property, and our Liberty is to have and enjoy our Property; and of our Liberty, and Property, the Law is the defence; which ſaith,—No Free-man ſhall be diſſeized of his Free-hold, Liberties, or Free-cuſtomes, &amp;c. nor any way otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; nor we ſhall not paſs upon him, but by lawfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land, <hi>Magn.

Is not the keeping of them ſo taken away, a diſſeizing him of his property, and a deſtroying of it, and his Liberty, yea his very Being, ſo far as the invading the Guard the Law ſets about him is in order thereunto? Calls not the Law this a deſtroying of a man? Is there any more than one common Guard or Defence, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Law, to Property, Liberty, and Life? And can this Guard be broken on the former, and the later be ſecure? Doth not he that makes an invaſion upon a mans property and liberty, (as he doth, who contrary to Law, which is the Guard, acts upon either) make an invaſion upon a mans life, ſince that which is the Guard of the one, is alſo of the other? If a penny or pennyes worth be taken from a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, may not by the ſame rule all a man hath be taken away? If the bound of the Law be broken upon a mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, on the ſame ground may it not be broken upon his perſon?

Whether it be ſo or no indeed, and to the Nation, thou haſt made it ſo to us.—Whom thou hast denyed the juſtice of our Liberty (when we were before thee, and no Accuſer or Accuſation came in againſt us) and the hearing of the wrong done to us who were innocent, and the doing us Right, and Bonds haſt thou caſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upon us to this day, under an unreaſonable and cruel Jaylor, for not performing that thy condition for conſcience ſake.

And becauſe we would not put them off, for conſcience ſake, the denying of us juſtice, who had ſo unjuſtly ſuffered, and hearing of us as to wrong, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault in thee against the very eſſence of thoſe Laws, yea, an overthrow thereof; for which things ſake, being of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance to the beings of men, ſo juſt, ſo equal, ſo neceſſary thoſe Laws were made, and all the proviſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to make a default in any one point of which proviſions, expoſeth to the ſaid penalty?

Surely, Friend, that muſt needs be a very great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the not forbearing of the doing of which, deprives a man of juſtice, of being heard, as to wrong, of the benefit of the Law, of thoſe Laws before rehearſed; the juſtice and equity of which for to defend, a man hath adventured his Blood, and all that is dear to him. But to ſtand covered, or with the Hat on, in conſcience to the command of the Lord, is made by thee ſuch an one, which is none in Law, and rendred upon us who are innocent, ſerving the living God effectually, though the Laws of God and of Man, and the Oath, and Equity, and Reaſon, ſaith the contrary, and on it pronounceth ſuch a penalty.

When a paper is delivered out of a mans hand, Alterations may be made in it to his prejudice, which on a ſudain looking over it may not preſently be diſcerned, But hearing it read up may be better understood, whether any ſuch alterations have been made therein. Couldſt thou in justice have expected, or required him otherwiſe to do, conſidering alſo how he was not unſenſible, how much he had ſuffered already being innocent, and what endeavours there were uſed to cauſe him further to ſuffer; Was not what he ſaid as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, a plain and ſingle anſwer, and ſufficient in the Law, though (as hath been demonstrated) contrary to the Law thou didſt act, and thy Office, in being his accuſer therein, and producing the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per againſt him.

               <p>Having thus declared his diſlike to diet them, the week being ended (according to their agreement at firſt, as hath been ſaid) the priſoners were at their own diſpoſe to provide for themſelves, and to it were neceſſitated by him, in regard he ſaid he would not diet them as formerly for forty ſhillings a week, and having given him a ſufficient rate before, that his extortive demand they could not anſwer, and therefore ſent for a maid of the town, and agreed with her, as their ſervant, to ſupply them with neceſſaries, promiſing her wages, and gave her monie to provide for them, according to their order, and to bring it to them in the priſon.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114738:21"/> Law, and were asked whether they owned Juſtices, one of them expreſſed himſelf exceeding filthylie of Juſtice:) but four of the priſoners friends coming in to ſee them when the dore was opened to let in thoſe vile men aforeſaid: the Goaler would not let them go out again; but lockt them in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and when the priſoners ſpake to him to let them out, he called the priſoners damnd dogges of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and kept thoſe friends priſoners there all night, as he beat and ſtruck with a great ſtaff two of them, till one of their armes was black, for accompanying them from their chamber to this filthy hole; of which they complained to the Major of the Town, but he took no notice thereof. Nor was he with all this his inhumane and unmercifull dealing ſatisfied, but about the 10. hour in the night, he came into the roome over their heads, with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who were drunk, and ſtampt the duſt down upon their heads and called them rogues and other filthy names, and on purpoſe he threw a pot of excrements, and piſt down upon their heads, and on their fire, to put it out, which was made to cleanſe away the ſtinking ayre: and the next night he came again, and ſtamped the duſt down on their heads, and piſt into this place where he had ſet them, and threatned to put them into Irons, and to chain them together to poſts, and to nail their eares to a poſt, and gagge their mouths, and called them hatchet-faced dogges, and damnd dogges of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and rogues and bad them kiſs, and lick, and put their noſes into that which is offenſive to modeſty to expreſs, and ſaid he would do what he could, that they might ly in priſon and rot, and threatned to put the fellons down to them: and whereas he uſed to lodge at his houſe, he came and lay over their heads, that he might be more ready to abuſe them: and 12 <hi>s.</hi> he demanded, to have the dore of that loathſome cell to ſtand open, and 20 <hi>s.</hi> a weeke for a chamber.</p>
               <p>Having received the injuries and abuſes aforeſaid from the Goaler, they asked him who had the power of the Goale over him, he anſwered nobody, but that the land &amp; houſes were <hi>Coll. Bennets,</hi> whom he ſaid, he had faſt enough under his hand &amp; ſeal, &amp; when they anſwered him their demand was not whoſe land &amp; houſes it was, but who had the power over the priſon, as it was a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114738:21"/> Priſon for the County, and over him and the Priſoners, in caſe of wrong and abuſe done to the Priſoners; He anſwered, No body but himſelf had the ſole power. Then they asked him, whether there was no appeal above him? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, no. Then they asked him, whether the Sheriff had no power over him, and the Priſoners, if Priſoners ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to him becauſe of abuſe from their Keeper? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Sheriff had nothing to do, neither with him, nor his Priſoners; and added as an argument, that when any were condemned to be hang'd, that the Sheriff had nothing to do to come into the Caſtle Priſon, but the Keeper was to deliver the Priſoners at the Caſtle gate to the Sheriff. Then they asked kim, whether the Juſtices of the County had any thing at all to do with him in the caſe as aforeſaid? He anſwered, that the Juſtices of the County had nothing at all to do with him. Then they asked him, whether the Mayor of the Town had any thing to do with him in ſuch caſe? He anſwered, If the Mayor come there, (meaning the Priſon) he would put him by the heels.</p>
               <p>This horrible tyrannie of the Goaler, and impudent affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that none had power over him, to whom appeal might be made by the Priſoners, as to the abuſes they received of him: Neither Sheriff, nor Juſtices, nor Mayor, to call him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but that he had the ſole power, and that above him there was no appeal, occaſioned a Repreſentation of the cruel uſages aforeſaid, and of what he affirmed of his having the ſole power of the Goal, and of his being accountable to any for what he did, to be drawn for the Juſtices, whoſe Seſſions at <hi>Bodmin</hi> was near, unto whom it was ſent for them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Captain <hi>Braddon</hi> by one of the Town, who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed to the particulars. Which when Captain <hi>Braddon</hi> had read, he aſſured thoſe Friends that brought it, to acquaint the Juſtices therewith, and in a convenient ſeaſon. When about a dozen Juſtices were together, the Relation, and the Friend, who was an eye-witneſs of paſſages, was called for, and before the Countrey did they cauſe it publickly to be read, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted much ſenſe of their injurious ſufferings, which they ſpake
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114738:22"/> unto in the behalf of the Priſoners, and againſt the Goaler, and declared, that the Priſoners were not Rogues, nor Thieves, nor Murtherers, nor were committed or ſued, neither ſhould they be ſo uſed, and that their perſons deſerved better uſage; and ſharply reproving the Goaler for his demanding 12 <hi>s.</hi> to have Doomsdale-door open to them, and 20 <hi>s.</hi> a week for a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they asked him, whether he had got men to make a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of, and told him they ſhould not pay a penny. And Captain <hi>Braddon</hi> publickly declared, that he would be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for their true impriſonment, that ſo they might be delivered out of that noyſome den, and from out of the Keepers power and cruelty; and gave himſelf ſecurity in a 100 <hi>l.</hi> of his own voluntary accord for their true impriſonment, as he ſignified to the Priſoners in a Letter. And the Juſtices ordered the Goaler to put them out of Dooms-dale. But further they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not with him than hath been rehearſed, he being not theirs, but Colonel <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Deputy, who then was not at the Seſſions. And thus did the Juſtices, (of which <hi>P.

               <p>The Juſtices declaring themſelves in the behalf of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and ordering their removal out of Dooms-dale, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and <hi>Edward Piot</hi> being fallen very dangerouſly ſick of a Feaver, to the hazard of his life, by reaſon of the poyſonous ſtench of that unwholſome place, (which continued upon him many dayes) put the Goaler under fear what would become of him, which not onely cauſed him to command the Priſoners (three dayes after his return from the Seſſions) out of Dooms-dale, after they had been kept there for the ſpace of 13 dayes, (who till he ſo commanded them forth) had not freedome to ſtir, though the doors were ſet open) into the Chamber where they were before, but kept him ſomewhat orderly and quiet awhile, permitting proviſions to be brought to them, and Friends to v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

More honour would it be, and juſtice for ſuch an ungodly one, who is ſet to rule over us, and Priſoners, to be ruled over, and more fit to be put into Priſon, than to govern a Priſon, and to be a chief Keeper in <hi>Cornwall,</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:114738:23"/> who is a Swearer, a curſed Speaker, often drunk, almoſt every day, and many times at twelve, one, or two of the clock at night, his Companions ſinging their filthy ſongs, and ſometimes fidling.</p>
                     <p>In our laſt writing unto you, we there acquainted you with what was paſt, here are ſome fruits which have proceeded ſince from this unſavoury Keeper againſt us, that you may ſee and behold what rules and governs, which is not pleaſing to God nor Man, that hath any gravity. As he hath daily reviled us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached us, and miſ-named us, ſo hath he encouraged others, fomenting his lyes of us both in Town and Countrey, ſtirring up the People to riot upon us, wiſhing before ſeveral People, and in one of our hearing, that the Town would riſe up againſt us; giving us threatning challenges,<note place="margin">This he would have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>May-day.</hi>
                        </note> with Swords four to four; and had gotten a fellow, of whom he boaſted, whoſe name is <hi>George Roach,</hi> under a pretence of ſpeaking to us of Scriptures, (who was brought in for drinking the Kings health, as himſelf ſaid) and when a Friend ſpoke to him, he threatned he would run his knife in his chops. It was told the Goaler, the plot was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards the ſame man in the ſight of the Goalers wife, came with a naked knife behind him, and wicked words in his mouth; and it was asked, what he had behind him, and bid him let's ſee what he had in his hand behind him, and after a little time we did ſee that he had a naked knife in his hand; and this is the Goalers man to talk of Scriptures. The Goaler being told of it, he anſwered, he could ſay nothing againſt him, although he had but a little before, when he came with a knife behind him, threatned to cut our faces in pieces.</p>
                     <p>And there came two women out of <hi>Wales</hi> to viſit us Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, one of which was a Juſtices ſiſter now in Commiſſion; theſe the Goaler abuſed with vile expreſſions, calling them <hi>Edward Pyot</hi>'s Whores before many People, and ſaid, God damn him, and many noyſome words and oaths, with threatning what he would do to them, calling them, Scums of the Countrey. And a Priſoner very much abuſed <hi>Edw. Pyot,</hi> and thruſt him down off a place where he was reading, and ſpeaking ſome Scriptures. He acquainted the Goaler with it, but the Goaler inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving him that did the abuſe, laid hands on <hi>Edw. Pyot,</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114738:23"/> did thrust him up and down, calling him many bad and filthy names, threatning to ſtrike him, and put him into Dooms-dale; and <hi>Edw. Pyot</hi> telling him that he ſhould acquaint the Juſtices of the County of his carriage towards us, he anſwered, he cared not for the Juſtices, they had nothing to do with him, nor his Priſoners. And when it was asked him, whether the Juſtices had nothing to do with him in caſe he abuſed his Priſoners, he anſwered, No Sirrah, they have not; and denyed that the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gave him any rebuke formerly for abuſing Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>The Goaler being drunk on a firſt day, (as he hath been on many) and having abuſed us, and miſ-named us, and brawled at us in his drunkenneſs the moſt part of the day, at evening a wild company came into the room under us, drinking, ſwearing, and curſing till midnight; and after they had abuſed us much in language, they ſaid they would drink our damnation, and our childrens after us. The ſecond day at evening, he was drunk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and <hi>Edw. Pyot</hi> not being well, ſent for ſome hot drink, and he would not ſuffer our Friend to bring it to him, but called her Quean, and Whore, and ſwore he would kick her; and about one of clock at night, he and they being beaſtly drunk, he came up in a rage, and barred up the door, when as we did not give him any words: And the next night came in drunk, and did as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and called us Rogues, and Runnagates, and reviled us with vile expreſſions, not fit to be mentioned. And this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury ſmell goes abroad with stinks; and when he is told of the Juſtices rebuke for abuſing of Priſoners, he ſaith, It's a ſmall matter for the Juſtices to call a man Knave.</p>
                     <p>We having a Friend brought to Priſon (though not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing any Law) for ſpeaking to a Prieſt after his time,<note place="margin">James Myres.</note> ſent by Juſtice <hi>Nicholls,</hi> and he being cast into Dooms-dale amongst Felons, a Friend that came to viſit us from <hi>Redding,</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114738:24"/> for men, unleſs there were more air, and the room kept more cleanly) or whether he might be with us his Friends who were Priſoners, judging it to be rather the Keepers malice, than the Juſtices order, to keep him from us. But the Juſtice, inſtead of anſwering his civil and reaſonable queſtion, asked our Friend wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ther he would work, and ſo committed him alſo to Priſon, although nothing of the ſtate of a Vagabond in the eye of the Law was found in him, but much the contrary, as having a Horſe to ride on, and money in his purſe, and himſelf coming in buſineſs, which the Law of this Nation owns, all which we may make apparent in time convenient, (theſe things are an ill ſmell to the Nation.) This Friend, who is called <hi>Joſeph Cole,</hi> hath been much abuſed in Priſon by the fore-mentioned <hi>Roach,</hi> a Priſoner, whom the Goaler brought to talk of Scriptures, who threatned to ſtab and cut our faces to pieces with his knife. This wicked and prophane fellow hath beat <hi>Joſeph Cole</hi> ſo, as he hath drawn blood of him, and ſtruck his head againſt the wall, and aſtoniſh'd him, and hath taken away his hat, ſo that he hath gone without his hat almoſt ever ſince the time of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The rude fellow before mentioned, beat <hi>James Mires</hi> Priſoner, committed by Juſtice <hi>Nicholls,</hi> ſo as he drew blood of him alſo, and cut his fleſh. And the ſame man did beat and ſtrike <hi>Benjamin Maynard,</hi> very nigh ſix months ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Recorder <hi>Gewen,</hi> (who ſtood in the Steeple-houſe, and ſaid nothing to the Prieſt nor People, till he was haled towards the door.) And from time to time, this deboyſt, unruly, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous fellow hath abuſed friends, threatning their lives, breaking their bones, tearing their fleſh off their backs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſwearing he would not eat nor drink till he had done it; a common Swearer, a filthy Curſer, and often drunk. And when Friends have demanded the hat of him, and ſpoken to him to be moderate, he hath anſwered with an oath, that he would cut the hat in pieces, and that which he had done he had order for. And the Goaler from time to time being told of theſe abuſes, never reproved him, but ſometimes anſwered, he could not help it, and that he could finde no fault with him, (envy and malice was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes blind.) Another time, to uphold and countenance him in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114738:24"/> his often wicked practiſes, accuſed us of Mutinies, who are ſufferers under the abuſive tongues both of the Goaler, and <hi>Roach.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Roach</hi> threatens to tear the fleſh off <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Salt</hi>'s back, and that he would kick <hi>Edw. Pyot,</hi> ſwearing God damn him, rot him, and ſink him, what he would do unto us. And this is the Goalers company, with whom he can finde no fault, (as he ſaith) but are drunk together day by day, and in their drunkenneſs come brawling and beating Priſoners, and glory in what they have done. And the Goalers wife hearing the Priſoners were beaten, ſhe ſaid, if ſhe were a man, ſhe would beat them too.</p>
                     <p>And thus the bond of Iniquity is strengthened againſt the Innocent; and the Goaler himſelf hath not onely encouraged, but done the ſame thing; for he ſtruck <hi>James Mires</hi> with a great cane, and beat <hi>Benjamin Maynard</hi> with a great cane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, back, and arms, with many blows; he beat him almoſt from Dooms-dale to the Caſtle-gate.</p>
                     <p>And there coming in a Maid of the Town, a Friend to viſit us the Priſoners, the Goaler locked her up in the Priſon with Friends, and ſaid, ye Rogues want a Whore, and kept her in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſix hours, and after came and tore her cloaths off her neck, and rent them to pieces, and ſtampt them under his foot, and beat her with a cane out of the Priſon, and after ſhe was out, he beat her to the ground twice; and the cruel mercileſs fellow beat her after he had amazed and aſtoniſh'd her, and knock'd her down, that her head was much bruiſed, her body and arms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding black; and this before many Witneſſes, which cryed ſhame upon him.</p>
                     <p>He hath endeavoured by all means to hinder Neceſſaries to be brought to us. One of the Town, who ſerved us in theſe things formerly, he arreſted for coming into his houſe, (which ſuit is yet depending) and he forbidding any of the Town, we have a Friend that came from <hi>London,</hi> who provides for us our diet, whom he hath much abuſed, ſtruck her on the back with a ſtick, another time kick'd her, and almoſt every day brawling at her, and threatning her, and calling her the worſt names he can think of. Another Woman, who brought neceſſaries to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114738:25"/> Priſoners, he met, and called her Whore, and Bitch, and if ever ſhe came there again, he ſaid he would beat her ſo, that ſhe ſhould not be able to go forth out of the Caſtle, but ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth on a Wheel-barrow. And he threatens <hi>Benjamin Maynard</hi> ſo, as that he would make him kneel down, and ask him forgiveneſs; and ſaid, he hoped to ſee him burned in the ſhoulder, and naked at a Gallows.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114738:35"/> can do herein. And for this end ſets his Watches and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Guards, at every Gate of the town to examine, ſearch and bring before him, thoſe who come to viſit them, the Letters he finds on ſuch, he breaks open, and detains as he pleaſeth; their Cloaths and Pockets he ſearcheth, and rifles; their perſons he abuſeth with filthy and unſavory expreſſions; he ſearched a womans head for Letters with his own hands, taking her fowl Cloaths out of her Hat, and ſearching them alſo. A Cheeſe ſent to <hi>Edward Pyott</hi> the Gaoler violently took away, ſaying he would carry it to the Mayors, for therefore was the Watch, and Ward ſet at every Gate, to ſtop all things that ſhould go to and from them, which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to this day. And <hi>William Salt</hi> after his being taken by order of the Seſſions out of that noyſome poyſonous hole, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Domeſdale, where he had been ill in his body, walking to <hi>Poulſons</hi> Bridge that parts <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> being a mile or thereabouts out of the town, to take the wholeſome ayr, upon encouragement thereof, and of Captain <hi>Bradens</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given ſecuritie for their true Impriſonment, for that very end that they might not be cloſely reſtrained, and cruelly uſed as they had been by the Gaoler. This Mayor (having notice thereof) cauſed to be taken and brought before him, (having ſet out Scouts and Watches to meet him at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn) and having himſelf rifled his Pockets, and taken away his Letters, to the darke houſe he committed him, telling him he would ſhew him a Law to morrow, and after he had lyen two nights and a day there by his order, ſent for him, and ſcoffed him, and asked him whether he would go into <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> again; and ſo ſent him to the Gaoler; who was a Priſoner in the County priſon, a priſoner upon ſecurity for his true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, over whom the Mayor had no power; but the ſame Spirit of crueltie ruling in him againſt the Innocent as in the Gaoler, he ſeeks and takes every opportunitie to manifeſt it, and in this mercileſs act hath exceeded the Gaolers unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable practice and inhumane brutiſhneſs. But by that time he comes to underſtand by feeling the wages of his unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,

               <p>And thus from this Gaoler, Recorder, and Mayor have the Innocent ſuffered without mercy. Theſe are they who have joyned hand in hand together, to make up the threefold Cord of their cruell perſecution. He that reads what hath been rehearſed of theſe three may ſee their faces, hearts, and hands, one and the ſame, as is the Spirit that rules them: The firſt cauſeth them to ſuffer, the ſecond helps on and then laughs at their ſufferings on the ſeat of judgement, inſtead of doing them right: The third reacheth forth his hand to make them further to ſuffer, where the two former cannot. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder is the Counſellor, from him proceeds the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtrength of the other two. This is he (as is ſaid) that was one of the ſecluded Members of the long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who after the Kings death being asked, in whoſe name the Orders of Court ſhould paſs, anſwered in the name of <hi>T.

The Mayor is he who was once put by that office for his diſaffection to the Common-wealth, and the priſoners in their day, having borne their teſtimony againſt thoſe intereſts, as they do now againſt all unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs, no wonder if at their hands they receive all manner of cruelties, now that they are put under their feet, and delivered up as a prey, and a ſcorn to all; who as to the intereſt of the Common-wealth, to which they firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtood, could not be overcome by the Sword or War, but overcame the Intereſts that theſe men purſued, and therein theſe men and all their Accomplices. And no wonder to ſee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114738:36"/> ſuch men as theſe creeping into places of power, thereby to have their opportunities of revenge on ſuch, and of making the Government under which they are to ſtink, and become intollerable becauſe of oppreſſion and crueltie, and of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating between thoſe who are chief in Rule, and their former conſtant friends; And is it not a fair game thus to play, whilſt it paſſeth undeſcerned acting under the power of authoritie, which when it is become ſufficiently naked, weak, and abort'd, if a blow then come it may be ſure to hit, and repentance may be too late. Men walk not in ſuch myſtery in theſe dayes, but they are eaſily diſcerned, as opportunitie ſerveth; their old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt appears to lie in the bottome ſure, and unmoveable, though their faces look another way, thither they rowe, (hath it not very lately appeared ſo throughout <hi>England?</hi> is it not a fair warning?)

               <p>The duty or office of Juſtices as well in Seſſions, as out of Seſſions, and of the Judges, is, not to make Laws, but to ſee that the Laws that are made be duely put in execution; with this they are entruſted, unto this they are ſworn; and where they ſwerve from this, they act arbitrarily, and are liable to puniſhment. Were the power of making Laws, of ſuch Laws as theſe, in them, what need is there of Parliaments? To what end have been all the ſharp conflicts, induſtrious care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, hard ſtrugglings, and bloody conteſts for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years paſt, eſpecially of late years, in the behalf of Parliamentary Authority, and the Fundamental Laws which from them ſprang, and which declare their Authority ſupream and abſolute?

Why was <hi>Strafford</hi>'s head cut off, and <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114738:41"/> and <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>'s, as Traitors, for endeavouring to ſubvert the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England?</hi> And what juſtice was there in all theſe, if a general Seſſions of a particular County may make Laws, ſuch Laws as aforeſaid, beyond what ever they did, and go unpuniſhed? Walk through the Records of this Nation, where the inſtances aforeſaid are regiſtred, (thoſe that are free thereunto) ſearch <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Trial, and <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s of late dayes, and ſee whether it was ever proved againſt them that ever they judicially made a Law againſt the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws and Liberties of this Nation, and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution?

Though arbitrary proceedings in ſuch as are entruſted with the execution of the Law, have been adjudged by Parliaments tyrannical and treaſonable, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Executions have been done accordingly, as hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced. Though any party of men under a Government, to make Laws, being not lawfully authorized ſo to do, for the binding of others, and thereunto to require obedience, be the ſetting up of themſelves above the Law, and treading it under their feet, and rendring of them whom they do ſo bind, their Slaves and Vaſſals, and ſo is treaſon. Though to raiſe men, and arm them, and to keep Guards with ſuch, apprehend and impriſon, where the Law doth not impower, (and no where doth the Law impower any ſo to do eſpecially, in oppoſition to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114738:42"/> Law, and Liberty, and the deſtruction thereof) is alſo Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Though Liberty of Conſcience is a chief Fundamental in the preſent Government. Though for the Liberties aforeſaid, and for it, have been the late wars, changes and revolutions which are the price thereof. Though to go about, doing of good, be that which <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and his Prophets, and Apoſtles did; and to viſit the Priſoners be that which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, even he who is the Son of man, the King, who when he ſhall come in his glory, and all his holy Angels with him, ſitting upon the Throne of his glory, before whom ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all Nations, whom he ſhall ſeparate the one from the other, ſaith to the Goats on the left hand, Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; for I was in Priſon, and ye viſited me not.

And ſo is an exerciſe of faith in Jeſus Chriſt the true Religion, which the Government requireth to be protected, as hath been mentioned. Yet have theſe Juſtices by a Law of their own making, (contrary to what hath been aforeſaid, (the Law of the Nation) and to what might further be added in demonſtration of the illegality and unreaſonableneſs of theſe their proceedings, could this ſhort Relation bear a full diſcuſſing thereof) ſet up armed Guards, under the name of Watches &amp; Wards on the high-ways and bridges throughout the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> requiring them to apprehend all ſuch, whom by and in their Law they reproach, diſtinguiſh, and brand with the ſcorned name of Quakers, as travel thereon; whom having a minde to deſtroy, and to keep from paſſing to viſit their Friends in Priſon at <hi>Lanceſton</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> ſuffering there for the teſtimony of Jeſus, as hath been ſaid; unto which place there is no paſſage out of <hi>England</hi> by land, but through that County; and to hinder from going to and fro that County, leſt they ſhould declare againſt, and manifeſt the wickedneſs in Prieſt and People. And that theſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114738:43"/> their cruel and tyrannical actions might have ſome pretence, and cover and prevail with thoſe in whom the ſame ſpirit ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, to execute them to the purpoſe.

And that this ſervice (as they call it, but poor hearts! they will one day ſadly know whoſe ſervice it is, when the Maſter payes them their wages) may be the better performed, they order that perſons of place and abilities, with ſufficient weapons, be thus ſet to watch and ward; and if any ſhall neglect their duties (as they term the obedience which they require to their illegal and monſtrous command) herein, they require the Conſtables thereupon forthwith to certifie the ſame to the next Juſtice, whom they deſire (by and in the name of this Court) to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the ſame, and to binde over to the next Seſſions, to anſwer the ſaid neglect.</p>

That though the Order bore date the 18. of the fifth month, called <hi>July,</hi> yet by the 23. of the ſame month were the Guards up, and ſome Friends travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Berkſhire</hi> from viſiting the priſoners at <hi>Lanceſton,</hi> were apprehended, and the next day impriſoned, and by the 16. of the 6. month, in the ſpace of about 25. dayes, were no leſs than one and twenty men and women impriſoned in <hi>Exeter</hi> of thoſe whom thoſe Guards apprehended, all of them except one (who was accompanying ſome of them to direct them the way thither from <hi>Exon,</hi> where he was born) being on their way to and from <hi>Lanceſton,</hi> to viſit, and from viſiting of the priſoners of the Lord there. And of theſe the Guards demanded, Are ye Quakers? Will ye own the Quakers? Will ye deny the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? We have an Order of Seſſions to ſtop and apprehend all Quakers; and ſo they fall to rifling of their pockets, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away what Letters, Papers, or Books they found about them, as did the Juſtices; one of whom, (to wit) <hi>John Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> called <hi>John Brown</hi> from the reſt that were apprehended with him, into his Parlour, and there beat him with his own hands, he ſtanding ſtill, and ſaying nothing; and then ſent him and the reſt (one of whom, <hi>viz. Jane Ingram,</hi> is ſince there dead) to priſon, where he was laid in irons, and ſome of them of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114738:44"/> their money did the Guards rob, (one man of 10 <hi>s.</hi> as they confeſs'd themſelves) and ſpent much of it before his face in ſtrong drink, abuſing him, and ſetting him forth a ſcorn through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Countrey as he paſſed; which he acquainted Major <hi>Saunders,</hi> one of the Juſtices, (who ſent divers of thoſe Friends to priſon) that he might do juſtice while the Conſtable was in Town who took away his money, and ſo uſed him; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſo to do, or to meddle therein. This is Major <hi>Saunders,</hi> and the end of his long and large profeſſion alſo; but hath now forgotten it, and is j yned with them, and with them is gone down to the pit, and his grave hath he made with the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumc ſed; who knew the day when thoſe at <hi>Exon</hi> roſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and his ſouldiers, as Hereticks and Schiſmaticks. And another who was carrying money and other proviſions to the priſoners, the Conſtable robb'd of 20 <hi>s.</hi> of that money at the eleventh hour of the night on the Guard where they had him priſoner, though he ſaid, if he took his money from him, they robb'd him. And one <hi>Parker,</hi> one of M jor <hi>Blackmore</hi>'s Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, charged the Inn-keeper at <hi>Exon</hi> to detain <hi>Katherine Evans</hi> hired horſe, (who with <hi>John Bolton, James Naylor,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Hawkins,</hi> were brought from <hi>Okehampton</hi> priſoners) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Inn-keeper refuſed to deliver her horſe, ſaying, he had an order from the ſaid Trooper to detain it, and that the ſaid Trooper ſaid he had order from his Major ſo to do. And after ſhe was ſo taken from her, a Juſtice ſent her on foot to her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being from tithing to tithing with a paſs; which horſe and the moneys aforeſaid are yet detained, as are the perſons of thoſe 21. in priſon in <hi>Exeter</hi> to this day, as is particularly inſtanced hereafter with their names, and by whom, and the Juſtices that committed them, and the proceedings of Judge <hi>Nicholas</hi> with them at the Aſſizes, to which the Reader is referred.</p>
               <p>And as from the Prieſts aroſe this unheard of cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſo were they not able (ſo full were they of it) to contain themſelves from appearing openly in acting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; of which an inſtance or two ſhall be given. On the 20. of the 6. month <hi>John Stubs, William Ames,</hi> and <hi>Heſter Bedle,</hi> as they were paſſing towards <hi>Lanceſton,</hi> met with a guard at <hi>Pogel,</hi> and

The Guard examined them firſt, and then paſs'd them over to the Prieſts. The Prieſts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving took them in hand, one of them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Parſon <hi>Waldron,</hi> ſaid to the Guard, Watchmen, you were beſt keep them, for they are ſuſpicious, and I do the more ſuſpect them becauſe they came from <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, they were. Then ſaid he to the Watchmen, you muſt not let them paſs, for therefore are the Watches ſet, that no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e might paſs who go under that name. And the other Prieſt them with much paſſion, they went about the Devils work, (who were going to viſit the Innocent in Priſon) and with his meſſage; and laughed and ſcoff'd at what one of them ſaid to him in the dread and power of the Lord. And Parſon <hi>Waldron</hi> ſaid, that he thought they muſt get the Countrey to knock them in the heads, or beat their brains out; and that if the power were in his hands, he would root them out of the land. And the Prieſt of <hi>Pogell</hi> ſaid, it was pity they were not all rooted out of the land. I'le warrant, ſaid Parſon <hi>Waldron,</hi> this Parliament will root them all-out; and this he ſaid ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times. And having ſpoken a notorious lye of one of thoſe Friends before the people of ſomething that was unſeemly, which the Prieſt ſaid he ſhould then do, which the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bore witneſs it was not ſo, having both ſeen and heard the paſſages, though he was taken with a lye in his mouth; yet ſo far was he from bluſhing, or being aſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>med, that he laughed thereat, and ſaid, Though he were a lyar, yet all were not like him. And having uſed much ſcoffings and railings, the Prieſts departed that night, after they had given order to the Guard to keep them priſoners. So by thoſe two Prieſts order were they kept ten hours priſoners. The next morning the Prieſt of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell</hi> came again, and railed at them while they were priſoners: whereupon one of them drew near towards him, to ſpeak to him; he retired back, and bid him ſtand off; and when he was asked, where his moderation was? he anſwered, he ought
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114738:45"/> not to be moderate in the things of God. And the woman he thruſt from him, and threatned to kick her about, and ſaid to the Watchmen, that they muſt be carried to <hi>Exon.</hi> And of the ſame minde was one Prieſt <hi>Ham</hi> at <hi>Lanceſton,</hi> who in his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Lecture-Sermon there exhorted the people to tread the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the people called Quakers in the ſtreet, and taught them how to write their names in the duſt. And another Prieſt drew the Warrant by which he was committed whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable robb'd of the 20 <hi>s.</hi> of the money he was carrying to the priſoners as aforeſaid, at the inſtigation of that Prieſt.

               <p>It would be too long to take this Monſter in pieces, and fully to deſcribe it; nor will this relation, which hath ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of unheard of illegal and monſtrous proceedings neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be ſpoken to, bear a large diſcourſe of this, or of divers other material paſſages mentioned therein; each of which (were it in the time of the former generation, wherein much was ſaid of a little, in compariſon to what is in this day acted) would increaſe into an entire and voluminous diſcourſe, which ſcarcely with the bare relation is now paſſed over. Such are the exceſſes of cruelty becauſe of conſcience, in this day of the higheſt profeſſion by the higheſt Profeſſors, that that which yeſterday made the whole Nation to ring, and drew forth the ſword of war to relieve it, paſſeth this day over in ſilence, and without obſervation, being look'd upon rather as favour than cruelty, as kindneſs than a furious perſecution; and it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted well where the extremity of ſufferings are not the Companions of thoſe who have the teſtimony of Jeſus. This Warrant lyes plain enough to be underſtood by him whoſe eyes are in the leaſt meaſure opened; who when he hath read the Prieſt of <hi>Talcots</hi> name that drew it, which is <hi>Whaire,</hi> and the Conſtable which robb'd that friend of the priſoners money, which is <hi>William Norcut</hi> of <hi>Clayton,</hi> is left to judge thereof as it is. The Guard apprehends him whom they call Quaker, at <hi>Clayton,</hi> as he was peaceably paſſing on the way with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the priſoners; the Authority is the Order of Seſſions; the Prieſt draws the Warrant, and in the Warrant uttereth his miſchievous deſires; the Juſtice ſigns and ſeals it; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable robs him of the money ſent by him to the priſoners to ſupply their neceſſaries after this commitment, whom ſo to do the Prieſt ſets on, and then ſends him to <hi>Exon</hi> Goal with a Guard; ſo they wrap it up. But not a word is there in this

Doth not here appear from the grave the ſpirit that was in <hi>Chriſtopher Love</hi> Prieſt, and his fellow traitors, who being within the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of this Commonwealth, took upon them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionate divers men to treat with <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Traitor of the Government, at <hi>Breda,</hi> and with the Scots, for the putting him into what they called his Father's Throne and Dominion in <hi>England,</hi> for which and his other Treaſons he loſt his head at <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> the 22. of the 5. month, 1651.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114738:47"/> plucked up root and branch, and theſe things ſo? Is it not time to look about? What is next?</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the fruits of the Miniſtry, Magiſtracy, Authority and Profeſſion of the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Grapes of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> cluſters of bitterneſs, wine of the poyſon of Dragons, of the cruel venome of Aſps. Theſe are ſome of the effects of the loud cry of the Order of Seſſions, ſome of the executions done by them to whom Major <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> makes it his earneſt requeſt, as they tender the hopes of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, the good of poor ſouls, and the peace of the Commonwealth, to do their utmoſt to ſee this order put in execution. Theſe are ſome of the living works of darkneſs from them to whom his requeſt is made, and his dead letter ſent for their direction, copies of which he deſires, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables pleaſe, (what a low condeſcention is here?) to be ſent to the petty Conſtables, that ſo it may be put in practice; and lo here it is, here is the practice, a wicked, robbing, bloody pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as it hath proved. Behold what his bidding them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident wherein his ſmall intereſt or aſſiſtance (filthy hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, which conceives that great which it expreſſeth ſmall, and would have it accounted great when it expreſſeth it little) for encouragement may be uſefull; and that he is their aſſured loving friend (of which he would have them be confident) hath brought forth. See to what his intereſt, and aſſiſtance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is; and whether this be the preventing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Satan, and his inſtruments, or his ſtratagems, and the carrying on of his deſigns, and the acting of his inſtruments therein, and that in the name of the Lord, let the ſober judge. And yet this Major <hi>Blackmore,</hi> when the Conſtables have brought him ſome of the Friends aforeſaid, whom they have taken up with theſe armed Guards as they were peaceably paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the way to viſit their Friends in priſon at <hi>Lanceston,</hi> at his earneſt requeſt in his Letter aforeſaid, and by vertue of the Order for that purpoſe, which he moved the Seſſions to make, hath ſeemed to be angry with the Conſtables for bringing them to him, when they have brought ſuch before him ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and refuſed to meddle with their commitment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114738:47"/> diſliked the action, and had nothing to do in the Guards, and the raiſing and placing of them for their apprehenſions, as he hath ſought to be underſtood in his diſcourſe to ſome of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, blaming the Juſtices for impriſoning of them, and ſaying that he impriſoned none. Is not this man worſe than <hi>Pilate,</hi> who apprehended not Jeſus, but ſought to releaſe him, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that for envy they had delivered him; and often ask-asked them, what evil hath he done? I finde no fault in him, nor <hi>Herod;</hi> and when he ſaw he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and waſhed his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am innocent of the blood of this juſt perſon, ſee ye to it. And is he not as bad as the high Prieſts, Scribes, Elders, and the whole multitude of them, who when they had gotten Jeſus to be betrayed, and with a band of men with ſwords and ſtaves to be apprehended, that they might crucifie him, ſent him to <hi>Pilate</hi> to crucifie him, but went not into the Judgement Hall, (why do you bring them to me? I like this not, I have impriſoned none) leſt they ſhould he defiled, and ſo not eat the Paſſeover? They know not to do right, ſaith the Lord, who ſtore up violence and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery in their palaces. Tremble O thou Earth at this, be thou aſhoniſhed, and horribly afraid, for the day of the Lord which is at hand, with whom this is laid up in ſtore, and ſealed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his treaſures, and the hour of his righteous judgements becauſe of theſe things haſtneth, to whom vengeance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and recompence.</p>
               <p>But theſe are not the firſt fruits of this Vine of <hi>Sodom</hi> in theſe fields of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> this City of <hi>Exon,</hi> and County of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi> the habitations of cruelty; early did this curſed branch bud early did it bloſſome, and ſend forth its poyſonous fruits.

And the cry is now hereſy, blaſphemy, ſedition, deniers of the godly Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> to be the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, venters and broachers of hereſies and blaſphemies; Arm, arm, turn them out, ſhut the gates againſt theſe Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, was the alarm then; ſet up Watches, Wards, armed with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient weapons, ſupplyed with men of place and ability; let none of them travel the Countrey, no not ſo much as to viſit their Friends in priſon; apprehend, impriſon them, is the Law now, by the men of the ſame generation, the Prieſts and their Diſciples. The walls of <hi>Exon</hi> were the bounds then, the whole circuit of the County of <hi>Devon</hi> is the extent now. That a kinde of a hurly-burly effected, this is done by a Law of the general Seſſions, by the Authority of the County, (not of the Protector) as ſaith Major <hi>Blackmore.</hi> That was to keep a Garriſon of thoſe they then called Hereticks out of the City, from guarding of them: This to ſet up armed Guards to take up and impriſon all ſuch of them whom they now call Quakers, that travel peaceably on the way without ſtaff or weapon. And what may not this generation be expected fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do, as they have power in their hands, and opportunity, if in ſuch things as theſe they may act and proſper? Have they not now learnt a way to keep any ſort of men from travelling, or paſſing, whom they diſlike? Put a brand upon them, fill up an order with monſtrous and falſe accuſations, and ſet up
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114738:50"/> armed Guards, make what themſelves have forged the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and all ſuch apprehend and impriſon. Is not this a fine way to deal with the preſent powers, if ever an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould adminiſter? Do they love them, do they affect them, (though they make uſe of them againſt the people of God called Quakers, whom they falſly accuſe with diſ-affection thereunto, and upon whom they make an eſſay of what they can do, and of their Authority) did the late publick occaſion manifeſt any ſuch thing, or the contrary? Have they not ſpread a plain leſſon before every County to do the like? and what is next? Are their eyes open who are chief in authority? Do they not yet ſee through theſe men, and things, and to what they tend? Doth it not concern them to look about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late? Have they not fair warning, and long and large experience? Alas, what doth it ſuffice us to deal with a few contemned Quakers, whil'ſt that ſtands which did put us by all our hopes of dominion over mens conſciences, and the State, and overturned us and all our deſigns with ſhame and diſhonour, with whom theſe Quakers were one, and ſome of them principal Actors; and whileſt the root is yet unpull'd up of that which hath laid an univerſal curſed toleration, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience, a chief fundamental in the Government. If this doth not concern you, O ye chief in Authority, and if this be not ſo, let it paſs.</p>
               <p>To conclude, This generation have in this particular of Watches and Wards exceeded the moſt bloody Perſecutors that have been known to have been on the face of the Earth; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whoſe thirſty ravenings after the blood of the Innocent, there is not found one ſuch example, no not among the red Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Roman perſecutions, or of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; onely in the beginning of the long Parliament ſome ſuch thing was ſet at <hi>Whitehall</hi> gate to hinder the multitudes of people which flock'd up out of the City to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to complain of their ſufferings by the Biſhops, and oppreſſions, which <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> called tumults, and ſo found fault with it, and by that Guard one of them was ſlain, at the place of the ſhedding of whoſe blood was <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>'s head ſtruck
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114738:50"/> off, and his blood poured forth on the ground; a remarkable record of the righteous judgement of God. And from the high Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees, was the Band ſent with ſwords and ſtaves, to take Jeſus in the Garden in the night', who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed no man, whom <hi>Judas</hi> led, who hang'd himſelf, and whoſe bowels guſhed out, though he returned the money, the price of the blood of the Innocent, whom he had betrayed to the chief Prieſts, ſaying, I have ſinned, and repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for him there was no place found. Conſider this ye, who having theſe examples before your eyes, do nevertheleſs dare to tread in their ſteps, ſetting up Guards, Watches, and Wards, with ſwords, and ſtaves, and halberts, betraying, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, impriſoning, and dealing with the Innocent, as hath been ſaid, who travel on the high-wayes quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, without ſword or ſtaff, to viſit their long and ſore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed innocent Friends in priſon, who witneſs the life of the ſame Jeſus (now) made manifeſt in them, which the ſame ſpirit that crucified Jeſus doth (now) in you riſe up againſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute for witneſſing thereof, and numbers amongſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, ſturdy Rogues, and Vagabonds: but thoſe who are indeed ſuch, and whom the Law calls ſo, not one of them is found in the Kalendar of thoſe your Priſoners, whom theſe your Guards have apprehended by vertue of your order: By which it is manifeſt who in your account were theſe Vagabonds and ſturdy Rogues placed in the front of your order, and who they were whom you thereby ſought to render vile and odious, and to apprehend, to wit, the Innocent and harmleſs lambs of Chriſt, who travelling peaceably on the way without ſtaff or ſword, you like Wolves have torn and devoured, and have drawn the ſword againſt, to ſtop and limit, when ungodlineſs and iniquity paſſeth every where without let, controul, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: Such for to ſtop your Guards have no order, of which the Priſoners at <hi>Lanceſton</hi> in one of their papers given out upon your Guards, have let you underſtand, as followeth.</p>

Doth it not here plainly ſhew that ye are of the world? Have not you your ſelves plainly declared? For do not ye hate them, the children of God? Do not ye perſecute them, ſet watches, ſnares, lay baits for them, take them up priſoners, and perſecute? Doth not Chriſt ſay, Who is not of the world, the world ſhall hate you? Doth not the Apoſtle bid the Saints not to marvel, for the world would hate them, for they were not of the world, and the world loved its own; they that are of the world, hear their own; they that are of God hear us, who are not of the world. Mark this, they that are of God hear us, were not ſuch as held up Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, Temple, firſt Prieſthood, that took Tithes of the world yea or nay. Was not the Temple worldly, and all to be judged and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114738:52"/> denyed? And are not your Teachers now made by the will of man, which perſecute, which be found out of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that now ye are haling your friends, them that the Lord ſends to do good unto you; now ye are haling your friends, now ye are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting your friends, now ye are ſmiting your friends, you will not have Chriſt to reign, you will not have ſin to reign in your markets and ſtreets; and if they reprove ſin in the gate, he is made a prey upon that doth it; you will have pleaſures to reign, and not have them reproved; he is called a mad man among you that doth reprove you, or a fool; you will not have drunkards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, nor ſwearers, nor curſed ſpeakers in the ale-houſes, or in the ſtreets abroad, but he is looked upon to be a peace-breaker, or a gatherer of tumults. And here you may ſee what you will to reign; that which the ſword ſhould be turned againſt, which the Lambs of Chriſt turn againſt, therefore againſt the Lambs of Chriſt ye turn your ſwords. And again, hirelings, and ſuch as ſeek their gain from their quarter, ſuch as divine for money, and ſuch Teachers as teach for money, that go in <hi>Cain</hi>'s way, and <hi>Balaam</hi>'s way, theſe ye will have to reign, and cannot endure they ſhould be cryed against, and will not have Chriſt reign, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them with a Law, that none ſhall ſpeak to them while they are ſpeaking without a Priſon? Was ever ſuch Chriſtians ſeen? Are ye not gone beyond the Jews in the letter? for the Jews in the ſpirit might ſpeak to them. Were there ever ſo many impriſoned in their time of any of the Jews in the ſpirit, as now by you who are Chriſtians in the letter, the Chriſtians in the ſpirit, that be in the ſpirit, that gave forth the letter, ſee ye now in the ſteps of the Jews walking, and rather worſe; but it is that which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, the Beaſt, the Dragon, and the falſe Prophet ſhould all make war againſt the Lamb, and the Saints, but the Lamb ſhould get the victory, and overcome. Let this be read among all the Synagogue-teachers, and Profeſſors, who call it either Synagogue, Temple, or Church, who are crying up your Church, and the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, as you may reade the Jews did the Temple of the Lord; and the Law of the Lord was with them, and the Prophet told them they did commit adultery, they did ſteal, they ſware falſly, they walked after their abominations, and they walked after the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114738:52"/> vanity of their own hearts, both Prieſts and People given to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, they were all out of the old-way: Therefore for theſe things did the Lord viſit them, and doth you who are found in theſe ſteps, and perſecuting them that be in the life, that gave forth Scriptures, and are come to the Church that is in God.</p>

               <p>Every Indictment, which hath not contained in it an offence, either againſt the Common lavv or Statute lavv, is void.</p>
               <p>But there is not in the Indictment of the Hat any offence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Common lavv, or any Statute lavv.</p>
               <p>If the matter of the Indictment be ſaid to be an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Common lavv, then it muſt appear ſo, either amongſt the Records of this Nation, or the judiciall determinations, and concluſions of the Chief Courts of Iuſtice.</p>

               <p>But that it is an offence either againſt the Common law, or Statute lavv, there is not ſo much as the leaſt tittle of lavv to prove it.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:114738:58"/>
               <p>Thoſe Adverbiall Words in the Indictment <hi>(viz.)</hi> Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, uncivilly, ſcornfully, maliciouſly, contemptuouſly, (with ſuch like filth, of which it is full, and not worthy the raking up) are, and have been alwaies taken to be added onely in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment the more fully to deſcribe an offence, and to aggravate the ſame; But if the act charged in the Indictment be not an offence without theſe words, then theſe words cannot aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, or compleate a deſcription of that which is not.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid to be done againſt good manners, evill communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations corrupt good manners, and whatſoever is more than yea, and nay, cometh of evill, ſaith Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God: and as to good manners, which you ſay it is againſt, produce your Law for ſuch good manners, and let us ſee what it is, O ſottiſh Generation.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid to be done againſt the uſage and cuſtome of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> It is the uſage and cuſtom of <hi>England</hi> for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſalute one another with a kiſs, and to ſpeak one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to come into Courts with Cloaks and Coats, and Gloves and Boots, and yet not an offence to leave it undone, or to come without any of there coverings. Things which are in a mans power to give, or not to give; and which he is content not to receive from others, when he gives not the ſame to others (as ſuch things as theſe are take them in the beſt ſenſe, as they are peculiar to every man, and at his choice whether he will give them or not) cannot be made criminall, if he doth not give them.</p>
               <p>And therefore the adding any of theſe vvords in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not make the not putting off the Hat to be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>And as their refuſing to put off the Hat, or to be uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is not an offence againſt the Law of this Common-Wealth, ſo neither is it an offence againſt the Law of God, or the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Not againſt the law of God, for there is neither precept, or preſident that makes it ſo, but the contrary, as hath been and might further be ſaid.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:114738:59"/>
               <p>Not againſt the law of nature, for nature makes no man free or a ſervant, but man is either free or a ſervant, according to the ſpirit that rules and hath command over him.</p>
               <p>And although it be ſaid in the Indictment, that they being enjoyned to be uncovered refuſed ſo to do, yet this makes not an offence, for the Juſtices ſate there onely to put the laws in being in execution, and it was not a contempt to deny to obey their command in a thing, which neither the law of God, nature, or of this Nation required to be done.</p>
               <p>This act of putting off the Hat hath been in this Nation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies taken to be an act of civill curteſie, and not of duty, and ſo the practice of it amongſt people of all ſorts high and low, rich and poor, and in all places as well in the high ways, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where doth manifeſt, and it is no other in effect than a meer volentary complement, the occaſion whereof was never held to be an offence till this preſent time, and that by ſome few particular perſons.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that people, for the moſt part ſtand bare in all Courts of Juſtice in this Nation, but this is more than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by any law, either of God or man, for that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be done to Magiſtrates is honour and obedience, which is demonſtrated by a ſubmiſſion to all lawful commands, and not by any complement or act of curteſie.</p>
               <p>Beſides to command any perſon to put off his Hat is abſurd, for that is to uſe it contrary to the end for which it was made, vvhich is to cover the head, and to keep it warme, whereby ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be prevented, and not to be held in the hand, and a wiſe man beginneth from the end of a thing, and weighs every thing as it is there.</p>
               <p>Again, whether the condition of a mans nature will give him leave to ſtand bare or not, the Magiſtrate is not the Judge, and therefore it is againſt reaſon, that it ſhould be in his power to command the Hat to be put off; whoſe nature cannot bear it from him that requires it, and is the ſame as to command him to put off any of his other Garments.</p>
               <p>From all which it is clear, that this Indictment, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114738:59"/> therein are neither warranted by the law of God, nature or of this Nation, but on the contrary, are meerly arbitrary, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon, and very abſurd, and an invaſion upon the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Freemen of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by what hath been ſaid (for to argue further is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in ſo frivolous a thing) the reaſonable may ſee what there is in this buſineſs of the Hat, which hath made ſuch a noiſe and kindled ſuch a fire in this Nation, by which ſo many of the innocent ſervants of the Lord have ſuffered without mercy, as hath been in part related; The tyrannicall wills and luſts of men being in this trifle ſet up above all that is called God, or man, or law, or nature, or reaſon, or common humanity, and againſt all theſe thus violently proſecuted, and cruelly, put in execution: As they may alſo ſee, what is become of this new ſound mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Indictment, and of all the abhominable filthy lyes, and falſe accuſations contained therein of which it is full; And of this Judge <hi>Nicholas</hi> and his will in the Law, according to what hath been now ſaid, and alſo declared in that Letter aforeſaid to the Chief Juſtice; And of the conſciences of the Jurors who have upon their oaths brought them in guiltie, of which they have made ſhipwrack, as they have of their own, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Country.

So the Lord God open your underſtandings that you may now ſee this great power of the Lord, which is now manifeſting among his children in this his day, that you may not withſtand it.

               <p>To theſe their anſwers the priſoners heard nothing till the next morning by Capt: <hi>Braddon,</hi> who ſending for ſome of them a litle after Generall <hi>Disborow</hi> was departed the town, ſignified, if they would engage as aforeſaid, and pay Fees, they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114738:64"/> might have a let paſſe to depart to their homes, but thereunto they could not conſent, and ſo returned to priſon.</p>
               <p>The ſame propoſition of liberty upon engaging to goe to their ſeverall homes, if the Lord permit, was ſent to the priſoners at <hi>Exon,</hi> in anſwer whereunto they wrote Generall <hi>Disborow,</hi> as followeth.</p>
               <p>We came into theſe parts ſtanding in the will and councell of the Lord, and it is our freedom where ever we are to ſtand in that councell, and if thou doſt ſet us at liberty in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which ought to be done, we ſtand in the Councell of our God, if he lead us to our outward habitations, we are free to go, but if the Lord move any of us elſe where, we dare not to be diſobedient, for he is a conſuming fire to thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, and we ſtanding in the will, and councell of the Lord muſt follow the Lamb whether he goes.</p>
               <p>And the priſoners of <hi>Lanceston</hi> ſignified in writing to Coll: <hi>Bennet,</hi> the unreſonableneſs of demanding of them to take a paſs upon neceſſity, when no ſuch thing is required of thoſe who have been charged with murder and fellony, or any ſuch thing found to be laid upon the Apoſtles in their travellings to preach Jeſus Chriſt, nor ought any ſuch thing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of the Innocent, for whom the Law is not made, but for the tranſgreſſor, and alſo of paying Fees, who had been ſo long detayned in priſon without being convicted of the breach of any Law of the Nation, who indeed no Law had tranſgreſſed, eſpecialy to ſuch a goaler under whom they had ſo ſuffered as aforeſaid, as they had given in their anſwer to the propoſition of liberty upon engaging to go to their reſpective homes, if the Lord permit.</p>
               <p>But litle heard they in anſwer thereunto till the 29. of the 6. month, at which time Collonel <hi>Bennet</hi> came to the town, and ſent for <hi>Edward Pyott,</hi> and <hi>William Salt,</hi> and reaſoned with them concerning the propoſition, and let paſs, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing from them therein, but according to what they had wrote, unto which they ſtood unalterable, and that if they lay there ſeven years, at the end thereof, they ſhould find them the ſame men, he friendly parted from them, and ſome
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114738:65"/> time after he and Capt. <hi>Braddon</hi> ſent for <hi>Edward Pyot,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Salt,</hi> and freed them and the reſt of the priſoners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition of going to their homes, or let paſs, or any other thing whatſoever, ſaying that they would not preſs them to any engagement, which might be any offence to that of God in their conſcience.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the goaler (though he was preſent when the Juſtices thus freed the priſoners without conſideration of Fees, or otherwiſe, for Fees they had in their papers denied to pay) did not ſet them at liberty, and being demanded by them the reaſon, he ſaid, they were free by the Juſtices order, but he detayned them for their Fees; and ſo now they became the Goalers priſoners, as they had been before <hi>P. Ceelies,</hi> and the chief Juſtice <hi>Glyn's,</hi> who herein acted contrary to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors Government, notſtithſtanding they put it under his name, and authority.</p>
               <p>Of this they ſent Collonel <hi>Bennet</hi> information, but nothing in anſwer they received from him, till the 8. of the 7. month, the next morning after which being the 9. of the 7. month, he came to <hi>Lanceſton,</hi> and ſet them at liberty freely, without any condition whatſoever. And ſo as innocently they came out of priſon, as innocently they were put in.</p>
               <p>After they were thus ſet at liberty free from any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they were caſt into priſon free of any offence, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their being detayned there free of any crime proved againſt them, <hi>William Salt,</hi> one of the late aforeſaid pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, went to <hi>Peter Ceelie,</hi> and deſired of him to reſtore the papers, and the Book againſt Popery (called by him ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous) which he took from them, when he apprehended them, ſeeing nothing contayned in them, as the tranſgreſſion of any Law was proved againſt them, <hi>P. Ceely</hi> anſwered he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to Generall <hi>Disborow,</hi> and afterwards ſaid to <hi>Edw. Pyot,</hi> he had delivered them to the Judge, ſee whether any truth be in this man (or any credit to be given to what he ſaid) and gave <hi>W. Salt</hi> high language, and ſaid, he would know where he had been, and whether he came thither without a paſs? The next day, being the firſt day of the week as <hi>W. Salt</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:114738:65"/> was walking alone waiting on the Lord, <hi>P. Ceely,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Vivian</hi> met him, as they were paſſing to the high place to worſhip, in the Parriſh called <hi>Guithion;</hi> and theſe very much urged him to come to their aſſembly, which <hi>P. Ceelie</hi> called the Communion of Saints, urging it again, and again, and asked him why he would walk there in the field, and not come to their meeting place, ſaying he might come, and hear, and then judge, he replyed he ſtood not in their wills, but if it were the will of the Lord to have him come thither, he ſhould do it. And afterwards being moved of the Lord he went, and when the Prieſt, one <hi>Tregoſſe</hi> a youth, one of <hi>P.

               <p>Into the Congregation. <hi>W. Salt</hi> came, being moved of the Lord, to which <hi>Pet. Ceely,</hi> and his companion often ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, as hath been ſaid, and now chargeth him with ſo doing.</p>
               <p>There he ſtood in the reverence and fear of the Lord God, who regards not the prayers of the wicked, which are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto him, nor can his ſaints, who pray to him in ſpirit, and worſhip him in ſpirit, bow to ſuch, and modeſtly and mildly did he there demean himſelf.</p>
               <p>Vilifie the vaine Lad whom he calls a Miniſter he did not, nor interrupt him (as they call it) but heard with ſilence, though he told the people a ſtorie of a Mule cloathed in a Lions skin, and then would tell them the Morall of it, when he was the Lion in the mules skin, as it afterwards appeared. The truth he ſpake, &amp; the ſpeaking of truth is not vilifying. He exhorted the people to mind Chriſt the Biſhop of their ſouls, that him alone might be their teacher, where they would find reſt to their ſouls,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114738:66"/> and told them that he that made them, was come to teach them, and thoſe who come hither, need not go forth. This is what he ſaid, and this it ſeems is vilifying in <hi>P. Ceelies</hi> account, as he called the paper given forth by <hi>G. F.</hi> directing people to the way to Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, only in the words of the Scriptures of truth, mentioned in the beginning of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, ſinfull, and wicked, and tending to the diſturbance of the peace, and therefore committed them, under which they have ſuffered without mercy, as hath been expreſt, ſo let him who reads and underſtands, ſee what a profane perſon, and unheard of blaſphemer is this <hi>P.

               <p>And ſpeak he did not till the young Prieſt was gone out of his pulpit; ſo here is another lye under his hand and Seale.</p>
               <p>Nor did he diſturbe the Congregation, for the people were very attentive to hear untill <hi>P. Ceely</hi> ſtirred them up to hale him out, ſo <hi>P.

               <p>For, firſt, in obedience to the movings of the Lord he came thither; and at his command ſpake in the words of ſoberneſs, and truth as hath been ſaid: And the Apoſtle ſaith, ye may all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie one by one, that all may learne, and all may be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; &amp; if any thing be revealed to another that ſtands by, let the firſt, hold his peace, 1 Cor. 14.30.31. but <hi>P.

                     <p>IT is recorded in the Scriptures of truth, that <hi>Paul,</hi> a ſervant of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> when he was a Priſoner under the Romanes, that he was ſuffered to dwell by himſelf, and he dwelt in his own hired houſe, and received all that came in unto him, preaching the Kingdome of God, and teaching thoſe things that concerned the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all confidence, no man forbidding him. And we do not reade that liberty of conſcience was one of the Fundamentals of the Roman Government, or that they had made proviſion by a Law for all that profeſſed faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, to be protected, though they were different from the doctrine, diſcipline, and worſhip, as was then in being, and not to be compelled thereunto, but won by ſound doctrine, and the example of a good converſation, as the Government of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath provided, as in the <hi>36.</hi> and <hi>37.</hi> Articles of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government. Neither do we reade, that liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was held forth by them to be a natural right, that every man might claim: Yet they that did not make this proviſion, ſuffered the thing; for all that would come unto <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſpake boldly the things concerning the Kingdome of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, no man forbidding him; which was far from ſending men to abuſe him, or make a ſport of him, or ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people that came to viſit him, whence they were, or what they would have there, or why they did not get them about their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or why come they there to be ſeduced, as was done to us the laſt night, who are Priſoners for the eternal truth, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and ſtand witneſſes for the Lord in our meaſures, as he did; yet we in our own Nation being Priſoners, who were cauſeleſly caſt into Priſon without the tranſgreſſion of any Law, and here to be brought in order to our trial, to hear what any man hath to

               <p>Being called in again, Colonel <hi>Bennet</hi> ſeeing them coming with their Hats on, called out, Why do you let theſe men come in with their Hats on?

And if Queen <hi>Maries</hi> law be repealed, what Prieſts are they that flye for refuge to it, to uphold their Ministry now? Or is it reaſonable to put men in priſon, as many have been, and ſome are, and there be kept when they have nothing to plead for their ſo doing but that law? And whether the Prieſts now claiming the priviledge of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> law, made for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Jeſuits and Priests in the excerciſe of the Popiſh and Idolatrous worſhip and ſervices, againſt the ſervants of the Lord many of which then ſuffered Impriſonment, and ſome in flames of fire, for witneſſing againſt them then, do not manifeſtly declare themſelves to be no Ministers of Jeſus Chriſt?

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114738:77"/> for that they could neither make promiſe, nor be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bonds and engagements themſelves; neither would they that any ſhould do it for them, and to do ſo both in word and writing they denyed.</p>
               <p>And ſo they were remanded to <hi>Lanceſton</hi> Priſoners, being thus returned in the Kalendar:</p>

               <p>Poor Colonel <hi>Bennet,</hi> how is the day of the Lord come upon thee? How are all thy coverings ripped off? Thy hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things, how are they ſearched out?

O how art thou blinded, and thy later end worſe than thy beginning? How hath the Spirit of the Lord ſtrove with thee, and ſought to ſave thee from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward generation? How hath he in thee raiſed up his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to teſtifie in the behalf of his innocent ſuffering ſervants, and to the making of thee in ſome ſort ſerviceable for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, which now teſtifies againſt thee, doing the ſame things, and is thy condemnation? What warnings haſt thou had? What ſeekings to cover thee hath there been, that thy nakedneſs might not have appeared, and ſo men might not have not ſeen thy ſhame? But thy heart hath been divided, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt not proſpered; thou haſt been unſtable as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

Thy profeſſion is at an end; all that thou haſt done and ſuffered for liberty, for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, and the Nation, thou haſt ſpilt upon the ground, it riſeth up in thy face, and thee doth judge; and amongſt the oppreſſers and perſecuters art thou found, even in their ſpirit, whom thou haſt fought againſt, againſt whom God hath ordained his arrows. Turn thee to the light, which will ſhew thee what thou haſt done, and how contrary thy actions have been each to other, and how thou art taken in an evil ſnare, for ſo hath the day of the Lord been upon thee, which he hath made manifeſt, and brought the ſecret head in the bottome of thy deceitfull heart to light, and left thee to record thy folly and ſhame to future, generations. And tremble thou before the Lord in this hour of his righteous judgements, who ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart, and tryeth the reins, and rendreth to every one according to their deeds; and be not as thoſe who will know no ſhame, leſt the hand of the Lord be ſtretched forth to harden thee, and cut thee off for ever: And talk no more of the Scriptures, nor of what was the life of the Saints, and holy men of God, nor of the Kingdome of Chriſt, nor of liberty, till to that thou art turned and ruled by, even the light, the life which comes from Chriſt, which is in Chriſt, unto which they were turned, in which they abode, and by which they were guided, who oppreſſed none, nor perſecuted, but were perſecuted and oppreſſed by thoſe in whom the ſpirit that is in the world ruled; who haſt oppreſſed the innocent, and perſecuted the ſame life in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114738:79"/> theſe, which ruled in the holy men of God, which life the world ever perſecuted, and put to death the Son of God, who is the light of the world, the light and life of men, the true light which lighteth every man that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world, who is come to reign and rule for ever, thouſands in this Nation witneſs him ſo to be, eternal living praiſes be to him for evermore, who will deſtroy the Oppreſſor, and none ſhall hurt in his holy Mountain. Therefore ſay thy mouth unto the duſt, and be thou aſhamed, yea, be thou confounded, and turn to him againſt whom thou haſt kicked, if ſo be there may be hope, and a healing of thine errour: then thou wilt ſee love in this, and contentedly wilt thou bear the ſhame of thine iniquity; and the unworthieſt of all, yea one not worthy to be counted a Saint, wilt thou then reckon thy ſelf to be, becauſe thou haſt perſecuted the Church of God. In love unto thy ſoul are theſe things wrote, and a warning from the Lord God is this unto thee, and his voyce is unto thee to turn at his reproof, and to thee his viſitation of love it is: therefore minde and conſider; which if thou do not, a witneſs for the Lord God ſhall I be eternally againſt thee: and if thou thinkeſt theſe things too hard, look into thy actions, and now in the cool of the the day, and with the light of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſearch thy ſelf, and with it do thou, and let all that are ſober, ſee, and judge, whether it be any more than the reward of thine own hands which is given thee, right meaſure, and juſt weight, which every one muſt receive at the hands of the Lord. And if thou haſt yet to ſay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am I made publick? Thou haſt ſpread the tent of thy iniquity upon the houſe top, and committed thy lewdneſs before the Sun, on the Seat of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there haſt thou done unrighteouſly, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Innocent, whom thou hadſt helped, who

            <p>On the 25. of the 10. month, the Mayor ſent for <hi>Edw. Dyer</hi> of Plymouth, and asked of him whether he would be bound that ſhe ſhould anſwer at <hi>Exon</hi> Aſſizes, for that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be examined (which was a notorious lye, for ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to examination, and was examined by them, as hath been ſaid.) He replyed, he would be bound for her appearing, and for her anſwering what ſhould be laid againſt her: then the Mayor ſaid, he muſt be bound for her good behaviour. He anſwered he knew of no good behaviour ſhe had broken; She refuſeth to be examined, ſaid the Mayor, and to give in her name. He replyed, ſhe told her name: the Mayor anſwered, the truth is ſhe did declare her name, but I, ſaid he, have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it, (and indeed he was in ſuch a rage when he examined her, that he remembred not what it was, though ſhe told him; and yet this he would make in her a misbehaviour, and for it requires ſureties.) He replyed, he would be bound ſhe ſhould not be drunk, nor beg, borrow, ſteal, play the whore, nor offer violence or wrong to any, (which is matter for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſureties for the good behaviour in the Law, but to this generation, declaring againſt ſuch things, is accounted ill behaviour, and for ſo declaring, ſureties for the good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour they require, ſo the Law, and judgement is turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,) the Mayor bid him go to the Town-Clerk, and what he did he would allow of. The Town-Clerk would have him be bound for her good behaviour; he refuſed to do otherwiſe than he had ſaid to the Mayor, the Mayor having declared, as hath been ſaid, that ſhe had misbehaved her ſelf in refuſing to be examined, (which ſhe did not) and to give her name, (which he confeſſed ſhe did) and that he had forgot it. Yet the Mayor ſaid again, he would take no ſecurity unleſs he would be bound for her good behaviour; he anſwered again, he knew not what they meant by the ill behaviour, for in the Biſhops days, when people met together in the fear of the Lord, it was accounted a conventicle, and a breach of the good behaviour, and that ſince on the ſame account doors had been broken open by the rude multitude in Plymouth; as he the ſaid Mayor well knew (for indeed, it was done in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114738:82"/> time of his former Mayoraltie in the year 1645. as hath been inſtanced in the former relation,) then <hi>John Martingdale</hi> of Plymouth being with <hi>Edw. Dyer,</hi> asked the Mayor what they would call the ill behaviour, the Mayor replyed, what the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices ſhould judge to be the ill behaviour, was ill behaviour, (ſo the Law, it ſeems by his reckoning, is not, but the breaſts of the Juſtices, the rule of behaviour, who (after this rate) may make what they will a misbehaviour, and ſo what inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man can be free, if they have a mind to make him an offender? and to their luſts in this kind how wicked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable ſo ever if he will not ſubmit, and ſubſcribe himſelf a tranſgreſſor, who is innocent, the penalty of the Law in caſe of that which it ſaith is indeed misbehaviour, muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him, as if he had broken the Law; and ſo their luſts preſcribe the Law, and the Law of the Nation muſt ſerve for the puniſhment of the tranſgreſſion of their luſts, as of the Law;) further he asked him, whether to ſay thee, and thou; which was Scripture language, was a breach of the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; to this the Mayor anſwered not: but ſome that ſtood by ſaid it was: he alſo told the Mayor that he knew the place from whence ſhe came, and that ſhe was no wanderer, and was well known to many in Plymouth beſides himſelf, but the Mayor would not hear him; ſo the diſcourſe broke off, and ended.</p>
            <p>But on the 27. of the 10. month, a Conſtable, and another man with him came to her; and bad her provide to go with them; ſhe ſpake to them to ſhew her their order. They ſaid they would not: ſhe ſaid ſhe was not free to depart thence till ſhe ſaw the order; they denyed her again; and haled her forth of the room, &amp; through the ſtreet, which when they had done, and drawn her a pretty ſpace out of the Town, ſhe demanded of them to ſhevv by vvhat order they did it, or vvhether they had a paſs, othervviſe ſhe was free to go no further. Hereupon the Conſtable pulled out a paper, ſhe bad him let her hear vvhat vvas in it, he ſaid ſhe ſhould not; ſo ſhe returned back into the Tovvn, into vvhich being come, the Conſtable brought her to the Mayor again; vvho upon ſeeing her vvaxed vvroth,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114738:82"/> and his countenance changed, and he ſaid, muſt he ſtill be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with her? would ſhe not be bound to the good behaviour, nor nothing? She anſwered him, ſhe was bound to the good behaviour by the Law of God, and asked him wherein ſhe had misbehaved her ſelf in word or action, and what Law ſhe had tranſgreſſed; and ſaid, that if ſhe had tranſgreſſed any Law, ſhe was willing to ſuffer by it: but he anſwered her not a word. She asked him why he dealt ſo with her, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hear her Paſs, that ſhe might know whither he meant to ſend her, ſeeing they had declared they knew not the place from whence ſhe came; he ſaid, ſhe ſhould not hear it; and bid her depart out of his houſe, and commanded the Conſtable to have her out of the Town: ſo the Conſtable charged a man to aid him, who laid hands on her, uſing her with violence, and much rudeneſs. But a woman ſpeaking to him in the fear of the Lord, he let go his hold, and would have no further to do with her: whereupon the Conſtable ſaid, he knew not what to do with her; but the Mayor commanded to put her in Priſon.</p>
            <p>Whereinto being brought again, the Mayor, and two or three more, came into the Hall, and conſulted together, but ſpake not to her, and ſo went out at the door, where were many Friends waiting, who were not permitted to come in to her; of which ſome of them ſpake to him, and that they might have liberty to ſee her. But inſtead of anſwering their equal, and juſt, and legal deſire, he, being filled with rage, laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on <hi>Margaret Reſtbridge,</hi> and puſh'd her from him down the ſtairs, which had endangered her life, ſhe being an old woman, but that many Friends being there, the preſs of them kept her from falling above two or three ſteps. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them he threatned with the Clink, and the door by command was opened to put them thereinto, for but deſiring leave to ſee her, and command he gave that none ſhould come at her, and cauſed her to be k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pt ſo two dayes and a night in a wide room without a fire, in that ſeaſon, which was very cold and bitter weather; out of which ſhe was put into a room, and fire permitted her, upon the ſpeaking of one to the Mayor
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114738:83"/> againſt his cruelty therein, he being moved of the Lord ſo to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>On the 31. of the 10. month, the Mayor, Juſtice <hi>Vowell,</hi> (who was Judge of the Court at the Seſſions at <hi>Exon,</hi> before whom ſhe was afterwards brought, with others called Juſtices, being met, ſent for her down into the Court, and demand they did her name, and her husbands name, and the place of their habitation, which ſhe refuſed to give them, having given it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them, and her Friend having given it alſo, (the Mayor confeſſing the one, but not caring to hear the other, as hath been ſaid) having before declared ſhe ſhould not give it them again, becauſe ſhe ſaw they thereby ſought to ſend her away with a Paſs, as a Vagabond, which ſhe was not; and which by the Law they could not do, unleſs ſhe had been taken beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and her name and place of habitation in the Paſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: but content ſhe was to ſubmit to the will of God, as to what power they had to do with her; and ſo they returned her again to Priſon.</p>
            <p>A few dayes after, <hi>viz.</hi> on the third day of the 11. month, between the ninth and tenth hour at night, came a Sergeant, and would have her open her chamber door; but it being ſo late in the night, and ſhe alone, ſhe told him ſhe was not free to open her chamber door; ſo he bid her prepare to be going to <hi>Exeter</hi> Priſon at ſix of the clock the next morning; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four of the clock the next morning came the Conſtable, and ſome others with him, and bid her open the door, which ſhe was not free to do, being alone, as hath been ſaid, and it being two hours to the day: but ſuch was the immodeſty and unreaſonableneſs of the Officer, that he called for a Smith, and broke open her chamber door at ſuch an unſeaſonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull hour, and haled her out of the room through the ſtreet to a ſtable, where was a Carriers horſes, and kept the ſtable door faſt, refuſing to let her Friends come in to her, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the violence, and inhumane dealing with her, came to ſee her before her departure; and on them out of the ſtable did they caſt water. She demanded of the Officers, wherefore they dealt ſo with her, or whether they had a <hi>Mittimus?</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114738:83"/> to ſhew it her, but ſaid, they would have her away; and becauſe ſhe was not free to get up on horſeback her ſelf, unleſs they would ſhew her a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> or by what Authority they uſed her after that manner, they put a rope about her, with which they load their packs, and with it at a pully twitcht her on the Horſes back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bound her arms behind her, and tyed her feet under the Horſes belly with cords, and ſo drove the Horſe, and her on it as a pack, yea even as if ſhe had been a Creature without life, ſenſe or feeling, for the ſpace of ten miles, bound with ropes after the manner aforeſaid, (ſuch an unmanly piece of ſalvage bruitiſhneſs, and inhumane cruelty, eſpecially to an innocent woman, tenderly bred, and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eſtate, as to the outward, hath not been heard of in this Nation, but is the monſtrous and unnatural fruit of the Government of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and of <hi>Christopher Ceely</hi> the Mayor thereof in particular, by whom the Witneſſes of the Lord have cruelly ſuffered, as hath been, and is yet to be mentioned. Are theſe Chriſtians? Or are theſe Men? Would not the worſt of Heathens have bluſh'd at the very relation of ſuch barbarous inhumanity? Nor have they left behind them on record (ſo far as is remembred) ſuch a noyſome ſmell to poſterity. But it is <hi>Plymouth,</hi> it is <hi>England,</hi> that leaves theſe filthy ſtinks to future ages, which is a lamentation.) After which, he that drove her having ſatiated his cruelty over which ſhe bore, and had dominion, he looſened her cords, and told her he had a <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi> to carry her to <hi>Exeter</hi> Goal, unto which he brought her, and there was committed a Priſoner till the general Seſſions of that County.</p>
            <p>Before whom being brought, many untruths (which the Mayor of <hi>Plymouth</hi> had ſent againſt her) were read, but not one witneſs appeared to convince her of the tranſgreſſion of any one Law of the Nation; nor would Juſtice <hi>Wowell</hi> (who was Judge of the Court, who had to do in her perſecution at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> as hath been ſaid) permit her, nor any of her Friends of <hi>Plymouth</hi> who were preſent, to ſpeak in witneſs of the truth on her behalf; but he ſaid, if ſhe would go to her husband, ſhe ſhould have her liberty, otherwiſe they would will and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114738:84"/> require her ſo to do. To which ſhe anſwered, In the will of God I ſtand, do with me what ye have power: for when they were not able to lay any breach of the Law to their charge, they thought to have blemiſhed her with being from her husband, (ſuch was their juſtice to an innocent woman, who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as is aforeſaid) But her husband (who as the Lord had ordered it, was but a little before come to the Town) being in the Court) and endeavouring to ſpeak, to take off that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended aſperſion, they would not hear him. Then a man ſtanding by, ſaid ſomething concerning his having heard her ſay as if the Scriptures were not the Word of God: ſhe looked upon him, and bid him minde what he had ſpoken, and let that in his conſcience witneſs whether he heard her ſpeak any any ſuch word (for what ſhe ſpake was no ſuch thing, as is hereafter made to appear, even under his own hand, it being in diſcourſe with him at an Inne, as ſhe was on her way from <hi>Plymouth</hi> Priſon to <hi>Exon</hi> Goal.) This the Judge of the Court caught hold on preſently, (for inſtead of delivering the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as is the Law, they ſought after cauſe to make her to ſuffer) and demanded of her whether ſhe owned the Scriptures to be the Word of God, yea or nay? She anſwered, what ſhe had ſpoken, ſhe would not deny; the Scriptures ſhe witneſſed to be a true Declaration, but Chriſt was the Word; mentioning the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life, and they are they that teſtifie of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And the man that accuſed her, declared to the Judge of the Court, that ſhe ſo ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures were a true Declaration, but Chriſt was the Word: Yet much ado the Judge made for her to ſay yea or no to his queſtion, that ſo he might enſnare her: And though ſhe anſwered him in the words that ſhe ſpake to the man that accuſed her, which was as much as legally, or in reaſon could be expected; and he who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her, affirmed it was ſo, as hath been ſaid, yet commanded he the Goaler to take her away, and required the man who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her, to prepare a Bill of Indictment againſt her; which contrary to his minde, and to what he had ſaid in evidence, the Clerk of the Seſſions, and the grand Jury drew up, wherein
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114738:84"/> ſhe was charged as a Felon, and (as they ſaid) the Bill was found by the grand Jury: but what ground they had in Law to form a Bill contrary to the Evidence, or to make that matter of an Indictment (ſuppoſe it had been ſpoken by her, as they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, and would have it to be) which is none in Law; for all Indictments are invalid, where the offence charged therein is not bottom'd on a Law; or to make that Felony by form, which is no offence in ſubſtance; and what conſciences ſuch a grand Jury have, as to form or finde ſuch a Bill for the taking away of life, made (as hath been ſaid) without ground in Law, or truth, or honeſty in form, nay contrary to the Evidence, yea to the witneſs his declaring to them at what they had drawn up, was not according to his minde, is plainly manifeſted, and their cruelty therein to the ſober, and men of underſtanding, by what hath been already ſaid; and what a generation of blind and bloody Monſters, exceeding in impudent wickedneſs all that have gone before them, this age ſo high in profeſſion, and ſo eminently delivered by the hand of the Lord, brings forth againſt his living truth, and innocent ſervants, but is made fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apparent, and the due weight and right meaſure of this charge, by the witneſs againſt himſelf, who wrote to <hi>Edw.

At which words the Judge of the Seſſions demanded of her whether the Scriptures were the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114738:85"/> Word of God, or no? She did not confeſs it, or deny it before them; but they enjoyned me to draw up a Bill of Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, which, as the Clerk under you drew up, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my minde, but as both they and the grand Jury ſaid, it muſt be ſo according to the form of the Law.

Whereby he intended with her, <hi>Richard Lippincot</hi> of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Hooton,</hi> who were then Priſoners for ſome ſuch thing.

The Jews, who put him to death, denyed him; and they which perſecuted his Apoſtles and Witneſſes, diſ-owned their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of him whom they declared: but this generation profeſs him in words, and call themſelves Chriſtians, and yet ſeek to murther them who teſtifie of him; <hi>Hang them th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
